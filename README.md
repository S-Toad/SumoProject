# SumoProject

This is mostly an experiment working with Arduino over Raspberry Pi (Hating it already). 

## Features
  * SumoRobot designed to find targets and charge at them
  * Aware of it's environment
  * Aware of collision(?)
  * Written in essentially c++

Project will be completely open source, as I get more and more done with this project, exact components used, exact model files, and etc., will be available for all to use! I'll also do my best to make these component classes open ended for anyone to get information from components easily.

This is a sloppy README for now, but will be updated as time passes with much more information!
